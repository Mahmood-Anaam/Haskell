CS 340 Lecture Repository
-------------------------

This repository contains lecture notes and sample code for CS 340: Patterns and
Paradigms of Programming. Notes reside in numbered files in "src", and are
mostly made up of literate Haskell files with intermingled English and code.

I will likely be making changes to these files throughout the semester, so
please be sure to pull the most recent changes before attending lecture. To
avoid merge issues, I recommend you create a separate branch for your own
additions and modifications so that you can always pull my changes into a
pristine local branch.
